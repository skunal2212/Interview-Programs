getting no of occurences of ovals from given string using php

To count the number of occurrences of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the given string using PHP, you can use preg_match_all() or substr_count(). Here's a simple way to do it:


<?php
$str = 'Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bono';

$vowelCount = preg_match_all('/[aeiouAEIOU]/', $str);
echo "Total number of vowels: " . $vowelCount;
?>


Solution using array_sum() and substr_count():

<?php
$str = 'Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bono';

$vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'];
$vowelCount = array_sum(array_map(fn($v) => substr_count($str, $v), $vowels));

echo "Total number of vowels: " . $vowelCount;
?>
